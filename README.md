Harry Potter: The Gen Z Edition

This project provides a place for anyone to collaborate on Harry Potter: The Gen Z edition, inspired by [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/r87mvh/accidentally_bought_the_gen_z_how_do_you_do/).

_**Anyone**_ is able to contribute by suggesting changes to files, as long as you have a GitHub account. It has to manually be
approved, so your changes will not be reflected immediately. If you created a change successfully, you should see it appear here:

https://github.com/typoes/harry-potter-gen-z/pulls

## How to make changes 
There are a couple of different ways to make changes, but the screenshots below are easiest for those who have never used GitHub. 

1. **Navigate to the file** you want to change from within https://github.com/typoes/harry-potter-gen-z

2. **Click edit** once you reach the page you'd like to edit

3. **Make your edits** and **click "Propose changes**.

4. **Double check that the drop-downs look correct.** It should be correct by default, but confirm that:
a) "base repository" points to `typoes/harry-potter-gen-z` and `main`
b) "head repository" points to `YOUR-ACCOUNT-NAME/harry-potter-gen-z` and your latest patch 

If the box at the bottom does not show the changes you made in green, you may have the wrong values selected in the dropdown.

To build the epubs, install Pandoc, and run `make all` in a terminal. If you're on Windows, like me, using
[Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install) to install both `make` and `pandoc` is the easiest way I know.
