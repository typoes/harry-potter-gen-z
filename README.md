Harry Potter: The Gen Z Edition

This project provides a place for anyone to collaborate on Harry Potter: The Gen Z edition, inspired by [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/r87mvh/accidentally_bought_the_gen_z_how_do_you_do/).

_**Anyone**_ is able to contribute by suggesting changes to files, as long as you have a GitHub account. 


## How to make changes 
There are a couple of different ways to make changes, but the screenshots below are easiest for those who have never used GitHub. 

1. **Navigate to the file** you want to change from within https://github.com/typoes/harry-potter-gen-z

2. **Click edit** once you reach the page you'd like to edit

3. **Make your edits** and **click "Propose changes**.

4. **Double check that the drop-downs look correct.** It should be correct by default, but confirm that:
a) "base repository" points to `typoes/harry-potter-gen-z` and `main`
b) "head repository" points to `YOUR-ACCOUNT-NAME/harry-potter-gen-z` and your latest patch 

If the box at the bottom does not show the changes you made in green, you may have the wrong values selected in the dropdown.
