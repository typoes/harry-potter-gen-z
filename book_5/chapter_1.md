Chapter 1: Dudley Demented

It was the hottest day of the summer, and Privet Drive was as boring as ever. The air was thick and still, the sun blazing down without a single cloud in the sky. Harry Potter was lying in the flower bed outside number four, trying to eavesdrop on the news through the open window.

Inside the house, Uncle Vernon was bellowing at the TV, as if his yelling could make it louder. Aunt Petunia was bustling around, pretending not to hear her husband's rants. Dudley, meanwhile, was lounging on the couch, glued to a reality show and munching on a packet of crisps.

Harry, on the other hand, was trying to stay out of sight. He knew if any of the neighbors saw him, there'd be endless gossip. And the last thing he needed was more drama from the Dursleys. He strained his ears, hoping for some kind of update on the wizarding world, but all he caught were bits and pieces about mundane Muggle stuff.

As he lay there, sweating and frustrated, his mind wandered to his friends. What were Ron and Hermione up to? Were they having fun without him? He felt a pang of jealousy and longing. He wished he could be anywhere but here, stuck in this dull, suffocating place.

Suddenly, a loud crash from inside snapped him back to reality. Aunt Petunia shrieked, and Harry quickly ducked down, hoping to avoid whatever fallout was coming next. Just another day at Privet Drive, he thought with a sigh.

After a few moments, he cautiously peered through the window again. Uncle Vernon had knocked over a vase in his rage, and Aunt Petunia was fussing over the mess. Dudley hadn’t even looked up from the TV. Harry shook his head, feeling a mix of irritation and amusement at the chaotic scene.

He decided to take a walk, anything to get away from the stifling atmosphere of number four. He grabbed a hoodie and slipped out the back door, heading towards the park. The streets were empty, the heat keeping most people indoors. As he walked, he kept an eye out for anything unusual, a habit he’d developed over the past year.

When he reached the park, he found a shady spot under a tree and sat down. He pulled out a letter from his pocket and re-read it for the hundredth time. It was from Sirius, his godfather, full of encouragement and advice. Harry felt a little better after reading it, but he still couldn’t shake the feeling of unease that had been nagging at him all summer.

Just then, he heard voices approaching. He looked up and saw Dudley and his gang swaggering into the park. Harry groaned inwardly and tried to make himself invisible. But it was too late; Dudley had spotted him.

"Oi, Potter!" Dudley called out, smirking. "What are you doing here, lurking like a creeper?"

Harry rolled his eyes. "Just minding my own business, Dudders. Why don’t you try it sometime?"

Dudley’s face turned red. He hated being called Dudders. His gang snickered, and he glared at them before turning back to Harry.

"Think you’re so tough, don’t you?" Dudley sneered. "Well, guess what? We’re not at your freak school now. You’re just a nobody here."

Harry stood up, not in the mood for Dudley’s nonsense. "Whatever, Dudley. Just leave me alone."

But Dudley wasn’t backing down. He took a step closer, and Harry instinctively reached for his wand. He knew he wasn’t supposed to use magic outside school, but he was ready to make an exception if Dudley pushed him too far.

Before things could escalate, though, the temperature dropped suddenly. Harry shivered and looked around, feeling a sense of dread. The sky had darkened, and a mist was rolling in. Dudley and his gang looked confused and a little scared.

"What’s going on?" one of Dudley’s friends muttered.

Harry’s heart pounded. He knew what this meant. Dementors. He could feel their presence, the cold, the despair. He pulled out his wand and stepped in front of Dudley, who was now trembling.

"Stay behind me," Harry ordered. "Whatever you do, don’t move."

The mist thickened, and two dark figures emerged, gliding towards them. Harry pointed his wand and shouted, "Expecto Patronum!"

A silver stag burst from his wand, charging at the Dementors. They recoiled and retreated, disappearing into the mist. The stag lingered for a moment before fading away. Harry lowered his wand, breathing heavily.

Dudley was on the ground, pale and shaking. His gang had scattered, leaving him behind. Harry knelt down and checked to make sure Dudley was okay. He was alive, but clearly traumatized.

"Come on, we need to get you home," Harry said, helping Dudley to his feet.

As they made their way back to Privet Drive, Harry’s mind was racing. Why were Dementors here? What did this mean for the wizarding world? He knew he had to get in touch with someone from the Order of the Phoenix, and fast.

By the time they got back to Privet Drive, Dudley was starting to look a bit more like himself, but he was still shook. Harry basically had to drag him up the steps and into the house. Aunt Petunia screamed when she saw them.

"What happened to my Dudders?" she shrieked, rushing over.

"He just had a little scare," Harry said, trying to keep it chill. "He’ll be alright."

Uncle Vernon stomped into the hallway, his face turning a scary shade of purple. "What did you do to my son, you freak?" he roared.

"I didn’t do anything!" Harry snapped. "We got attacked by Dementors."

"Dementors? What kind of nonsense is this?" Uncle Vernon bellowed. "I’ve had enough of your lies!"

"It’s not a lie!" Harry shouted back. "We were attacked, and I saved Dudley’s life!"

Aunt Petunia gasped, clutching her pearls. "Dementors," she whispered, looking like she’d seen a ghost. "Those horrible creatures..."

Harry was shook that she knew what Dementors were. Before he could ask, a loud crack echoed through the house. Harry spun around to see a silvery creature hovering in the air. It was a Patronus, speaking with a familiar voice.

"Harry, stay put. Help’s coming."

The Patronus vanished, leaving the Dursleys looking like they’d seen a ghost. Harry felt a wave of relief. The Order was on their way. He just had to keep things from going totally off the rails until they got there.

A few minutes later, there was a knock at the door. Harry opened it to find two wizards standing there. One was tall and serious-looking, the other a woman with kind eyes.

"Hey, Harry," the woman said. "I’m Mrs. Figg. This is Kingsley Shacklebolt. We’re here to help."

Harry quickly filled them in, and Kingsley nodded. "We need to get you both to safety," he said. "Dudley’s had a rough go, but we’ll take care of him."

Mrs. Figg turned to the Dursleys. "I know this is wild, but you need to trust us. We’ve got this."

Uncle Vernon looked like he was about to lose it, but Aunt Petunia placed a hand on his arm, surprisingly calm. "Vernon, let them help."

With a lot of grumbling, Uncle Vernon agreed. Mrs. Figg and Kingsley checked Dudley with some spells. Harry watched anxiously, hoping his cousin would be alright.

"He’s gonna be okay," Mrs. Figg said. "He just needs some rest. Dementor attacks are no joke, but he’s tough."

Harry breathed a sigh of relief. "Thanks."

Kingsley turned to Harry. "We need to bounce. It’s not safe here. We’ve got a safe spot for you."

Harry nodded. "What about my stuff?"

"We’ll grab it," Mrs. Figg said. "You just get ready to roll."

As they went upstairs to pack, Harry felt a mix of relief and worry. He was glad to be leaving the Dursleys, but he couldn’t shake the feeling that something big was going down in the wizarding world. If Dementors were out in the open, things must be bad.

Once they had his stuff packed, Kingsley led Harry downstairs. Aunt Petunia was fussing over Dudley, who was starting to come around. Uncle Vernon was still glaring but kept quiet.

"Good luck, Harry," Aunt Petunia said softly as he passed. Harry paused, surprised by her tone. He nodded and followed Kingsley out the door.

Outside, a car was waiting. Kingsley opened the door and motioned for Harry to get in. "We’ll explain everything on the way," he said.

Harry climbed into the back seat, and Kingsley got in next to him. Mrs. Figg waved as the car pulled away from Privet Drive. Harry watched the house disappear, feeling a strange sense of finality.

As they drove, Kingsley caught him up. "The Ministry’s in denial about Voldemort’s return," he explained. "That’s why the Order of the Phoenix is back. We’re working to protect everyone and get the real scoop."

Harry listened, soaking it all in. He felt a surge of determination. He was ready to join the fight, no matter what.
