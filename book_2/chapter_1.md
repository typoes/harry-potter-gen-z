Them hoes at 4 Privet Drive was wildin again. Pappa Dursley's beauty-sleep (cuz those neck rolls ain't fluffin themselves) was interrupted at butt-o'-clock by some loud-ass hooting sound from Harry's lair under the stairs. 

"Third time this week!" he roared across the table, his lil mustache flapping in the wind. "If you can't control that owl, it's outta here!"

Harry gave explaining another shot.

"She's *bored*," he said. "Sitting in this house is unbased. If you would stop gatekeeping: I could let her out at
night-"

"Do I look stupid?" snarled Uncle Vernon, a bit of fried egg dangling from his floofy mustache, like dingleberries on ass hair.
"I know what'll go down if that owl's let loose."

He exchanged dark looks with his wife, Petunia.

Harry tried to argue back but his words were overshadowed by a long, mega burb from the Dursley's
son, Dudley.

"I want more bacon."

"There's more in the frying pan, sweetums," said Aunt Petunia, turning misty eyes on her fucking massive
son. "We must build you up while we've got the chance.... I don't like the sound of that nasty school
food...."

"Nonsense, Petunia, back in my day I never went hungry when *I* was at Smeltings," said Uncle Vernon heartily.
"Dudley gets enough, don't you, son???"

Dudley, who was so large his ass drooped over either side of the kitchen chair, grinned and
turned to Harry.

"Pass the frying pan."

"You've forgotten the mAgIc wOrd," said Harry irritably.

The effect of this simple sentence on the rest of the family was incredible: Dudley gasped and
fell off his chair with a crash that shook the whole kitchen; Mrs. Dursley gave a small scream
and clapped her hands to her mouth; Mr. Dursley jumped to his feet, veins throbbing in his
temples.

"I meant 'please'!" said Harry quickly. "I didn't mean-"

"WHAT HAVE I TOLD YOU," thundered his uncle, spraying spit over the table, "ABOUT SAYING THE 'M'
WORD IN OUR HOUSE?"

"But I-"

"HOW DARE YOU THREATEN DUDLEY!" roared Uncle Vernon, pounding the table with his fist.

"I just-"

"I WARNED YOU! I WILL NOT TOLERATE MENTION OF YOUR ABNORMALITY UNDER THIS ROOF!"

Harry stared from his purple-faced uncle to his pale aunt, who was trying to heave Dudley to his
feet.

"All right," said Harry, "*all* right..."

Uncle Vernon sat back down, breathing like a winded rhinoceros and watching Harry closely out of
the corners of his small, sharp eyes.

Ever since Harry had come home for the summer holidays, Uncle Vernon had been treating him like
an impostor that might go off doing sus things at any moment, because Harry Potter *wasn't* a basic boy. As a matter of
fact, he was as quirky as it is possible to be.

Harry Potter was a wizard -- a wizard fresh from his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and
Wizardry. And if the Dursleys were unhappy to have him back for the holidays, it ain't shit to how
Harry felt.

He missed Hogwarts so much it felt like having a constant stomachache. He missed the castle, with its
secret passageways and ghosts, his classes (thought perhaps not Snape, the Potions master), the mail
arriving by owl, eating banquets in the Great Hall, sleeping in his four-poster bed in the tower
dormitory, visiting the game-keeper, Hagrid, in his cabin next to the Forbidden Forest in the grounds,
and, especially, Quidditch, the most popular sport in the Wizarding world (six tall goalposts, four
flying balls, and fourteen players on broomsticks).

All Harry's spellbooks, his wand, robes, cauldron, and top-of-the-line Nimbus 2K broomstick
had been locked in a cupboard under the stairs by Uncle Vernon the instant Harry had come home. What
did the Dursleys care if Harry lost his place on the House Quidditch team because he hadn't practiced
all summer? The Dursleys were what wizards called **Muggles** (not a drop of magical blood in their veins),
and as far as they were concerned, having a wizard in the family was a matter of deepest shame. Uncle
Vernon had even padlocked Harry's owl, Hedwig, inside her cage, to stop her from carrying messages to
anyone in the Wizarding world.

Harry looked nothing like the rest of the family. Uncle Vernon was large and neckless, with an thicc
black 'stache; Aunt Petunia was horse-faced and bony; Dudley was blonde, pink, and an all-around chonker. Harry on the
other hand, was a small boi, with brilliant green eyes and jet-black hair that was always untidy.
He wore round glasses, and on his forehead was a thin, lightning-shaped scar.

It was this scar that made Harry so particularly unusual, even for a wizard. This scar was the only hint
of Harry's very mysterious past, of the reason he had been left on the Dursleys' doorstep eleven years
before.

At the age of one year old, Harry had somehow survived a curse from the greatest Dark sorcerer of all time,
Lord Voldemort, whose name most witches and wizards still feared to speak. Harry's parents had died in
Da Big V's attack, but Harry had escaped with his lightning scar, and somehow -- nobody understood why --
Daddy Voldemort's powers had been yeeted the instant he had failed to 
postpartally abort Harry.

So Harry had been brought up by his dead mum's sis and her husban'. He had spent years with the Dursleys
never understanding why he kept making odd things happen without meaning to, believing the Dursleys' story
that he had got his scar in the car crash that killed his parents.

And then, exactly a year ago, Hogwarts had written to Harry, and the whole story had come out. Harry had taken
up his place at wizard school, where he and his scar were famous... but now the school year was over, and he
was back with the Dursleys for the summer, back to being treated like a stanky dog that had rolled in something sus.

The Dursleys hadn't even remembered that today happened to be Harry's twelfth birthday. Of course, his
hopes hadn't been high; they'd never given him a real present, let alone a cake --  but to always dis it
completely...

At that moment, Uncle Vernon cleared his throat importantly and said, "Now, as we all know, today is a
very important day."

Harry looked up, hardly daring to believe it.

"This could could be the day I'm gonna make some BANK," V-boi continued.

Harry went back to his toast. *Of course*, he thought bitterly, *Uncle Vernon was talking about his stupid
dinner party*. He'd been talking of nothing else for two weeks. Some rich builder and his wife were coming
to dinner and Uncle vernon was hoping to sell out (Uncle Vernon's company made drills.)

"I think we should run through the schedule one more time," said Uncle Vernon. "We should all be in
position at eight o'clock. Petunia, you will be -- ?"

"In the lounge," said Aunt Petunia promptly, "waiting to welcome them graciously to our home."

"Good, good. And Dudley?"

"I'll be waiting to open the door." Dudley put on a foul, simpering smile. "Maybe I take your coats, Mr.
and Mrs. Mason?"

"They'll *love* him!" cried Aunt Petunia rapturously.

"Excellent, Dudley," said Uncle Vernon. Then he rounded on Harry. "And *you*?"

"I'll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending I'm not there," said Harry tonelessly.

"Exactly," said Uncle Vernon nastily. "I will lead them into the lounge, introduce you, Petunia, and pour
them drinks. At eight-fifteen -- "

"I'll announce dinner," said Aunt Petunia.

"And, Dudley, you'll say -- "

"May I take you through to the dining room, Mrs. Mason?" said Dudley, offering his fat arm to an invisible
woman.

"My perfect little gentleman!" sniffed Aunt Petunia.

"And *you*?" said Uncle Vernon viciously to Harry.

"I'll be in my room, making no noise and pretending I'm not there," said Harry dully.

"Precisely. Now, we should aim to get in a few good compliments at dinner. Petunia, any ideas?"

"Vernon tells me you're a *wonderful* golfer, Mr. Mason.... *Do* tell me where you bought your
dress, Mrs. Mason...."

"Perfect... Dudley?"

"How about -- 'We had to write an essay about our hero at school, Mr. Mason, and I wrote about *you*.'"

This was too much for both Aunt Petunia and Harry. Aunt Petunia burst into tears and hugged her son, while
Harry ducked under the table so they wouldn't see him laughing.

"And you, boy?"

Harry fought to keep his face straight as he emerged.

"I'll be in my room, making no noise and pretending I'm not there," he said.

"Hell yeah," said Uncle Vernon forcefully. "The Masons don't know anything about you and it's
going to stay that way. When dinner's over, you take Mrs. Mason back to the lounge for coffee, Petunia,
and I'll bring the subject around to drills. With any luck, I'll have the deal signed and sealed before
the news at ten. We'll be shopping for a vacation home in Majorca this time tomorrow."

Harry couldn't feel too excited about this. He didn't think the Dursleys would like him any better in
Majorca than they did on Privet Drive.

"Right -- I'm off into town to pick up the dinner jackets for Dudley and me. And *you*," he snarled at
Harry. "You stay out of your aunt's way while she's cleaning."

Harry left through the back door. It was a brilliant, sunny day. He crossed the lawn, slumped down on the
garden bench, and sang under his breath:

"Happy birthday to me... happy birthday to me..."

No cards, no presents, and he would be spending the evening pretending to not exist. He gazed miserably
into the hedge. He had never felt so depresso. More than anything else at Hogwarts, more even than playing
Quidditch, Harry missed his best friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. They, however, didn't seem to
be missing him at all. Neither of them had written to him all summer, even though Ron had said he was going
to ask Harry to come and stay.

Countless times, Harry had been on the point of unlocking Hedwig's cage by magic and sending her to Ron and
Hermione with a letter, but it wasn't worth the risk. Underage wizards weren't allowed to use magic outside
of school. Harry hadn't told the Dursleys this; he knew it was only their terror that he might turn them all
into dung beetles that stopped them from locking *him* in the cupboard under the stairs with his wand and
broomstick. For the first couple of weeks back, Harry had enjoyed muttering nonsense words under his breath
and watching Dudley tearing out of the room as fast as his fat legs would carry him. But the long silence
from Ron and Hermione had made Harry feel so cut off from the magical world that even taunting Dudley has
lost its appeal -- and now Ron and Hermione had forgotten his birthday.

What wouldn't he give now for a message from Hogwarts? From any witch or wizard? He'd almost be glad of a
sight of his archenemy, Draco Malfoy, just to be sure it hadm't all been a dream....

Not that his whole year at Hogwarts had been fun. At the very end of last term, Harry had slipped through
Voldemort's clutches for a second time now, but it had been a narrow escape, and even now, weeks later,
Harry kept waking up in the night, drenched in cold sweat, wondering where Voldemort was now, remembering
his livid face, his wide, mad eyes-

Harry suddenly sat bolt upright on the garden bench. He had been staring absent-mindedly into the hedge --
*and the hedge was staring back*. Two enormous green eyes had appeared among the leaves.

Harry jumped to his feet just as a jeering voice floated across the lawn.

"I know what day it is," sang Dudley, waddling toward him.

The huge eyes blinked and vanished.

"What?" said Harry, not taking his eyes off the spot where they had been.

"I know what day it is," Dudley repeated, coming right up to him.

"Well done," said Harry. "So you've finally learned the days of the week."

"Today's your *birthday*," sneered Dudley. "How come you haven't got any cards? Haven't you even got friends
at that freak place?"

"Better not let your mum hear you talking about my school," said Harry coolly.

Dudley hitched up his trousers, which were slipping down his fat bottom.

"Why're you staring at the hedge?" he said suspiciously.

"I'm trying to decide what would be the best spell to set it on fire," said Harry.

Dudley stumbled backward at once, a look of panic on his fat face.

"You c-can't -- Dad told you you're not to do m-magic -- he said he'll chuck you out of the house -- and
you haven't got any where else to go -- you haven't got any *friends* to take you-"

"*Skidaddle skadoodle,*" said Harry in a fierce voice. "*your dick is now a noodle.*"

"MUUUUUUM!" howled Dudley, tripping over his feet as he dashed back toward the house. "MUUUUM! He's going to
do you know what!"

Harry paid dearly for his moment of fun. As neither Dudley nor the hedge was in any way hurt, Aunt Petunia knew
he hadn't really done magic, but he still had to duck as she aimed a heavy blow at his head with a soapy frying
pan. Then she gave him work to do, with the promise he won't eat again until he'd finished.

While Dudley lolled around watching and eating ate ice cream, Harry cleaned the windows, washed the car, mowed
the lawn, trimmed the flower beds, pruned and watered the roses, and repainted the garden bench. The sun blazed
overhead, burning the back of his neck. Harry knew he shouldn't have risen to Dudley's bait, but Dudley had said
the very thing Harry had been thinking himself... maybe he *didn't* have any friends at Hogwarts....

*Wish they could see the famous Harry Potter now*, he thought savagely as he spread manure on the flower beds,
his back aching, sweat running down his face.

It was half past seven in the evening when at last, exhausted, he heard Aunt Petunia calling him.

"Get in here! And walk on the newspaper!"

Harry moved gladly into the shade of the gleaming kitchen. On top of the fridge stood tonight's pudding: a huge
mound of whipped cream and sugared violets. A loin of roast pork was sizzling in the oven.

"Eat quickly! The Masons will be here soon!" snapped Aunt Petunia, pointing to the two slices of bread and a lump
of cheese on the kitchen table. She was already wearing a salmon-pin cocktail dress.

Harry washed his hands and bolted down his pitiful supper. The moment he had finished, Aunt Petunia whisked away
his plate.

"Upstairs! Hurry your ass up!"

As he passed the door to the living room, Harry caught a glimpse of Uncle Vernon and Dudley in bow ties and dinner
jackets. he had only just reached the upstairs landing when the doorbell rang and Uncle Vernon's pissed face
appeared at the foot of the stairs.

"Remember, boy -- one fucking sound-"

Harry crossed to his bedroom on tiptoe, slipped inside, closed the door, and turned to collapse on his bed.

The trouble was, there was already someone on it.
