# Chapter 2
## THE GLASS THAT YEETED ITSELF

It was like an eternity, like ten years, since the Dursleys had woken up to find their bb nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive was still super basic. The sun revealed the same front garden and shiny brass number four on the Dursley's front door; it crept into their living room, which was almost identical to the night when Mr. Dursley saw the fateful news report about them hooter birbs. Only the pics on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed. Ten years ago, there had been lots of pics of what looked like a chonky ball wearing different colored bonnets - but Dudley Dursley had the worst glo up ever, and now the pics showed a chonky blonde boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing Amogus with his dad, being xoxo-ed by his mom. The room lowkey didn't show that another boi lived in the house, too.

Yet Harry Potter was still there, catchin Zs at the moment, but not for long. His Aunt Petunia was awake and shrieked in her Karen voice for the first noise of the day.

"Up! Get up! Now!"

Harry woke with a start. His aunt tapped on the door again.

"Up!" she screeched. Harry heard her trodding toward the kitchen and then the sound of a frying pan being put on the stove. He rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having. It was sick. There had been a flying motorcycle in it. It totes felt like deja vu.

His aunt teleported back outside the door.

"Are you up yet?" she demanded.

"Kinda," said Harry.

"No cap you need to look after the bacon. And don't you dare let it burn. I want everything gucci on Duddy's bday."

Harry groaned. So done.

"What did you say?" his aunt snapped through the door.

"Nothing, nothing..."

Dudley's bday - how could he have forgotten? Harry slowly unstuck himself from his bed and started hunting for socks. He found a pair under his bed and, after pulling  a spider off one of them, put them on. Harry was used to spiders, because the dusty ass cupboard under the stairs was full of them, and that was his zone.

Once clothed he skirted his way down the hall into the kitchen. The table was smol beneath all Dudley's bday gifts. It looked as though Dudley had gotten the new chromebook he wanted, not to mention the second television and the racing bike. Harry was confusion as to why Dudley wanted a racing bike, as Dudley was a big heckin' chonker and hated gains - unless of course it involved throwing hands. Dudley's fave punching bag was Harry, but he couldn't often catch him. Harry didn't look it, but he was fast af.

Prolly had something to do with living in a dutty cupboard, but Harry had always been smol and scrawny for his age. He looked the farthest from swole because all his fits were second hand clothes of Dudley's, and Dudley was fourish times as thicc as him. Harry has a gangly face, knobbly knees, black hair and bright green eyes (like Harry Styles). He wore circle glasses held together with a lot of Scotch tape bc of all the times he had caught Dudley's hands with his face. The only thing Harry liked about his lewk was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He had had it as long as he could remember and thought is gave main charater energy. Since his life was uninteresting asf the first question he could ever remember asking his Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it.

"When your parents wrecked their whip and unalived." she had said. "And don't be askin questions."

Don't ask questions - that was the numero uno rule for living a basic life with the Dursleys.

Uncle Vernon vented in the kitchen as Harry was flippin' the bacon.

"Comb your hair!" he barked, by way of a morning greeting.

Bout once a week, Uncle Vernon peeped over the top of his tablet and shouted that Harry needed a new do. Harry's prolly had more haircuts than the rest of the bois in his class together, but his hair didn't give a fuck and simply grew that way -like an overfertilized chia pet.

Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley vented in the kitchen with his birther. Dudley was a mini-me of Uncle Vernon. He had a chonky pink face, hardly any neck, smol watery blue eyes, and lotsa blonde hair that lay flat upon his fugly head. Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley looked like a bb angel - Harry often said that he looked like a rejected plus size cabbage patch doll. 

Harry put the feast of eggs and bacon on the table, which was supa hexagon hard bc there wasn't much room. Dudley, meanwhile, was countin' is presents. His privileged face fell.

"Thirty-six," he mathed, looking up at his mother and father. "That's two less than last year."

"Bae, you haven't counted Auntie Marge's present, cop a look, it's here under this big one from Mummy and Daddy."

"All right, thirty-seven then.", said Dudley, color changing to bright red. Harry, who could sus out a huge Dudley bitchfit coming on, began chugging down his bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley yeeted the table over. 

Aunt Petunia saw the red flags, too, because she said quickly, "And we'll cop you another two presents while we're vibin' today. How's that, qt? Two more gifts. Is that aiight?"

Dudley strained as the wheels turned in his head, ever so slowly. "So I'll have thirty... thirty..."

"Thirty-nine, homeslice," said Aunt Petunia. 

"Oh." Dudley flopped down in the chair and grabbed the nearest present. "Aight then."

Uncle Vernon chuckled. 

"Lil dude just wants to get his dough's worth, just like his pop. That's mah boi, Dudley!" He ruffled Dudley's hair. 

At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap the racing bike, a video camera, a drone, sixteen new computer games, and a blueray player. He was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia came back from the telephone looking like somebody peed in her cornflakes. 

"Shitty news, Vernon," she said. "Mrs. Figg's clumsy ass broken her leg. She can't take him." She jerked her head in Harry's direction. 

Dudley's mouth fell open in horror, but Harry's heart did a ziggy. Every year on Dudley's bday, his parentals took him and a homeboy out for the day, to tot awesome adventure parks, bougie restaurants, or the dope movies. Every year, Harry was left behind with Mrs. F, a crazy old bat who lived two streets away. Harry hated it there. The whole house had a buttbreath smell of cabbage and Ms. F made him look at pics of all the kitties she'd ever hosted.

"Now what?" said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry as though he had schemed the whole thing. Harry knew he ought to care that Mrs. F's leg was broke, but it wasn't easy when he reminded himself that it would be a whole year before he had to look at Tibbles, Snowy, Mr. Paws, and Tufty again. 

"We could text Marge," Uncle Vernon suggested.

"You're kiddin', right? She hates the boi."

The Dursley's often spoke about Harry like this, as though he wasn't there - or rather, as though he was something cringe that couldn't understand them, like a slug.

"What about what's-her-name, your homie - Yvonne?"

"On vacay in Majorca," snapped Aunt Petunia. 

"You could just leave me here," Harry put in hopefully (he'd be able to watch what he wanted on Netflix for a change and maybe even troll the forums on Dudley's chromebook). 

Aunt Petunia looked as though she'd just swallowed a lemon. 

"And come back and find the house in ruins?" she bitched.

"I won't blow up the house," said Harry, but they were boycotting him. 

"I suppose we could take him to the zoo," said Aunt Petunia slowly. "... and leave him in the car..."

"That's my new whip, he ain't gonna chill in it alone..."

Dudley began to wail. Fact, he wasn't really crying - it had been years since he had felt real emotions - but he knew if he screwed up his face and made unhappy noises, his mother would give him anything he wanted. 

"Diny Duddydums, don't cry. Mummy won't let him spoil your special day!" she cried, flinging her arms around him. 

"I ... don't... want... him... t-t-to come!" Dudley gasped for air between huge, pretend sobs. "He always sp-spoils everything!" He shot Harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mother's arms. 

Just then, the doorbell rang - "Oh, sweet baby Jesus, they're here!" said Aunt Petunia frantically - and a moment later, Dudley's bff, Piers Polkiss, walked in with his mom. Piers was a scrawny boi with a face like a rat. He was usually the one who held people's arms behind their backs while Dudley threw hands. Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once.

Half an hour later, Harry, who couldn't believe his luck, was sitting in the back of the Dursley's car with Piers and Dudley, on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life. His aunt and uncle hadn't been able to think of anything else to do with him, but before they'd left, Uncle Vernon had pulled Harry aside. 

"I'm warning you," he had said, putting his large purple face all up in Harry's grill. "I'm warning you now, boi - any funny business, anything at all - and you'll be in that cupboard from now until Christmas."

"I'm not going to do anything bro," said Harry. "Legit..."

But Uncle Vernon didn't believe him. No one ever did. 

The problem was, weird shit often happened around Harry and it was no good telling the Dursleys he didn't do things. 

Once, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from Great Clips looking as though he hadn't been there at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs, which she left "to hide that cringe disfigurement." Dudley had laughed himself silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day, where he was already teased for his lack of style. Next morning, however, he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off. He had been given a week in his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to explain that he couldn't explain how it had grown back so quickly. Not cool.

Another time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting old sweater of Dudley's (brown with orange puff balls). The harder she tried to pull it over his head, the smaller it became, until it might have fit a barbie doll, but certainly wouldn't fit Harry. Aunt Petunia decided it must have shrunk in the wash and, to his great relief, Harry wasn't punished. 

On the other hand, he'd gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens. Dudley's gang had been chasing him as usual, as much to Harry's surprise as anyone else's, there he was sitting on the chimney. The Dursley's received a very angry letter from Harry's headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school buildings. But all he'd tried to do (as he shouted at Uncle Vernon through the locked door of his cupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors. Harry supposed that the wind must have caught him mid-jump. 

But today, nothing was going to go wrong. It was even worth being with Dudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasn't school, his cupboard, or Mrs. Figg's cabbage smelling living room. 

While he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia. He liked to complain about things: people at work, Harry, the council, the bank, and Harry were just a few of his favorite subjects. This morning it was motorcycles. 

"...roaring along like maniacs, the young gangstas,: he said as a motorcycle overtook them.

"I had a dream about a motorcyle," said Harry, remembering it suddenly. "It was flying."

Uncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front. He turned right around in his seat and yelled at Harry, his face like a giant beet with a mustache: "MOTORCYCLES DON'T FLY DUDE"

Dudley and Piers were laughing their asses of. 

"I know they don't," said Harry. "It was only a dream."

Big yikes, he wished he hadn't said anything. If there was one thing the Dursleys hated even more than him asking questions, it was his talking about anything acting abnormally, no matter if it was a dream or cartoon - they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideas. 

It was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded with fams. The Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers some B&J Ice cream at the entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van asked Harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away, they bought him an off-brand lemon ice pop. It wasn't bad either, Harry thought, licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like Dudley, except that it wasn't blonde. 

Harry had the best morning he'd had in a long time. He was careful to walk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that he wouldn't catch hands from Dudley and Piers, who were starting to get bored of the animals by lunchtime. They ate in a zoo restaurant, and when Dudley had a tantrum because his kickerbocker glory didn't have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first. 

Harry felt, afterward, that he should have known it was all too good to last.
